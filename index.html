  <hr>

<h3> Musical career </h3>
<hr>
<p>Encouraged by his friend Gaetano Curreri, Rossi released his first EP on 13 June 1977, which included the songs <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sAZ0ekeDui8">"Jenny Ã¨ pazza"<a/> and "Silvia", and a full-length album in 1978, Ma cosa vuoi che sia una canzone. In 1979, he released a second album, Non siamo mica gli americani, which included, "Albachiara", one of his biggest hits, a ballad considered emblematic of Rossi's poetic style. His most controversial album, Colpa d'Alfredo followed in 1980; many journalist's called him a drug addict. Rossi argued that evidently they did not understand his music and remarked how easy it is to criticize a still unknown artist who cannot defend himself. In 1981, the album Siamo solo noi was released. In 1982, Rossi took part for the first time in the Sanremo Music Festival, performing the song "Vado al massimo". Here, he once again found himself under harsh criticism, and came in last place in the festival. In April of the same year the album Vado al Massimo was released. The following year, he reappeared at the Sanremo Music Festival, this time performing <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VNHSL0pTlzA">"Vita spericolata"<a/>. The following album, Bollicine, published in 1983, was his sixth in seven years, and was the album that consecrated him definitively as an idol of the new generation and an icon of Italian rock. The title track, whose lyrics are about Coke (but also demonstrate a clear assonance with cocaine), won the Festivalbar '83, and his tour that year was an enormous success.

As he sang in one of his famous songs ("Voglio una vita spericolata"), Vasco has never been an easy person, rebellious and with a great desire to express his creative vein.</p>
